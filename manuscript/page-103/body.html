It came from the girl—the stenographer.  She got fresh while you were out, and I had to lock her up in the safe to keep her quiet.  I think there is enough air to last her some time yet; but her last squeal was rather faint.  Suppose you run up and let her out!”</p><p>Peters, with a scared look on his face, made one bound for the stairs.</p><p>“Hold on, man!” Brainard shouted after him.  “You don’t know the combination.  Here it is!”</p></div> </div>
