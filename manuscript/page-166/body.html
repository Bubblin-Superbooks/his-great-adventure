In Mexico they let the individual alone.  You see, the Church is supposed to look after the morals of the community.  That is a great relief—it simplifies life and makes it much more honest.  The Church does the best it can, and the State helps it out when necessary.  But the Church don’t expect too much, the Catholic Church I mean, of human beings, and so it isn’t disappointed.  It all works beautifully!  You’ll never find in Mexico such a fool performance as that going on in San Francisco to-day.  They’re no puritans in California either.  They don’t want reform—they don’t want to shut up the cafés and French restaurants and prevent the city council from getting its little rakeoff—not a bit of it!  It’s only this puritan bug has got hold of some ‘better than thous’ among us, and they are raising hell.”</p></div> </div>
